# FrogShooting

# DEMO


# Features

We've made the game more playable by adding features that allow players to take more risks.
Specifically, we've added enemies that can be healed and enemies that cannot be dealt with immediately.
For example, enemies that can be healed are green enemies. By making it so that the score is not added, we've changed the enemies from "enemies that are okay to kill" to "enemies that are good to hit," allowing players to choose whether or not to hit them.
